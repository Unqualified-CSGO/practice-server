## Installation

To get started you need to download this repo by pressing the green `Code` button and download it as a zip. You can then extract it to where you want.

Next we need to open the Powershell in admin mode:

- Win + R
- Type powershell
- ctrl + shift + enter

After that you need to copy your location of the server and then do this:

- cd "YOUR_LOCATION"
- ./start-here.ps1

Just follow the prompts and it should be fairly automatic. However, keep in mind:

**Symbolic linking will not allow you to play CSGO during the update**

## Updates

It's important to update your game first if you used symbolic linking. If you didn't then you can just run the update.bat.

The reason it's recommended to update game first is due to that it might break the symbolic links. That can increase the installation size of the server and can cause your game to have missing files.

## Uninstall

You can just delete the folder you extracted it to.
